Generate Steering Rules

---

**Assistant:**

I'll analyze the repository and create the steering documents. Let me start by examining key files to understand the project.

Now I'll create the three steering documents based on my analysis of the codebase.

Done. I've created three steering documents in `.kiro/steering/`:

- **product.md**: Describes ConstructLM as a privacy-first RAG workspace with local embeddings, multi-model AI support, and source citations
- **tech.md**: Documents the React 19 + TypeScript + Vite stack, key libraries (Transformers.js, Gemini/Cerebras APIs), and common commands
- **structure.md**: Outlines the component/service architecture, data flow patterns, and file organization conventions

These documents capture the essential context an AI assistant would need when working with this codebase - the product vision, technical stack, and architectural patterns.

**User:**

I SENT U A REQUEST and you were working on the implementation but suddenly the application where are you function in VS code crash so I couldn't see if you have already finished the request implementation or you were interrupted midway just confirm for me here if you are aware of the request I sent you or not so I can resend you to verify the implementation

---

**Assistant:**

I can see the steering documents I just created (product.md, tech.md, and structure.md) are now being loaded as workspace rules, which confirms they were successfully created.

However, I don't have any context about a previous request you mentioned before the crash. The conversation history I can see only shows:

1. You asked me to analyze the repository and create basic steering rules
2. I created the three steering documents (product.md, tech.md, structure.md)

If there was another request you sent before or after that, I don't have visibility into it due to the crash. Please resend your request so I can help you with the implementation!
